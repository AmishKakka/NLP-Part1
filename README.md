# NLP-Part1

Natural Language Processing a part of machine learning which is overwhelming and at the same time necessary. This repository is all about it.

I have used the IMdB movie reviews dataset to train on, which has 50,000 different movie reviews. the training set has 34,000 reviews and the rest is for validation set.


I have trained it using first Logistic regression classifier, second using traditional neural networks and at last using LSTM network.

This repository will be updated soon.
